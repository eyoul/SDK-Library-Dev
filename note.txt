The three tests that were skipped in your pytest output are likely due to the conditions set within the test functions 
themselves. In your tests/test_mpesa_sdk.py file, there are checks for environment variables that must be configured 
for the tests to run. If these environment variables are not set, the tests will be skipped.
Here are the specific reasons based on the provided code:

1. test_stk_push(mpesa_client): This test checks if the MPESA_SHORTCODE environment variable is set. If it is 
not configured, the test is skipped.

    if not shortcode:
       pytest.skip("MPESA_SHORTCODE not configured")

2. test_c2b_registration(mpesa_client): Similar to the previous test, this one also checks for the MPESA_SHORTCODE
 environment variable. If it is not set, the test is skipped.

    if not shortcode:
       pytest.skip("MPESA_SHORTCODE not configured")

3. test_b2c_payment(mpesa_client): This test checks for multiple environment variables: MPESA_SHORTCODE, 
MPESA_INITIATOR_NAME, MPESA_SECURITY_CREDENTIAL, and TEST_PHONE_NUMBER. If any of these are not set,
the test is skipped.

    if not all([shortcode, initiator_name, security_credential, test_phone_number]):
       pytest.skip("One or more required environment variables are not configured")

To resolve the skipped tests, ensure that the required environment variables are set correctly in your 
environment before running the tests. You can do this by creating a .env file or setting them directly 
in your environment.
